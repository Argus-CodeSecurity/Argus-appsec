# Understanding your scan results

Argus gives you **measurable security signals**, not a simple “secure / insecure”
badge. This page explains every number and status a user sees — in the terminal,
in CI, and in Argus Cloud — so you can decide whether your project meets **your**
policy.

!!! tip "The one-minute version"
    Run `argus scan . --fail-on high`. **Exit code 0** and **zero Critical/High
    findings** means you pass the most common team bar. Push to Argus Cloud to
    track whether posture **improves or regresses** over time.

---

## What “secure” means with Argus

Security is **posture**, not perfection. Argus answers:

> “Given the checks we can run on this target, are there issues at or above the
> severity my team cares about — and are we getting better or worse?”

A **passing** scan does **not** guarantee:

- No zero-day exploits
- No business-logic bugs visible only in production
- No social-engineering or physical attacks
- Complete coverage of every language and runtime

A **passing** scan **does** mean:

- Nothing at/above your `--fail-on` threshold was found **in the scanned paths**
- Your CI gate (if configured) stays green
- You have a recorded baseline to compare against on the next run

Argus is explicit about this in every scan: findings are **strong signals to
review**, not legal proof of safety.

---

## The summary box (terminal)

After every scan you see a box like this:

```
╭──────────────────────────── Argus scan ────────────────────────────╮
│ my-app                                                             │
│ Aggregate risk: 44.9/100   Findings: 26                            │
│ Critical: 0 · High: 0 · Medium: 26 · Low: 0 · Info: 0            │
╰────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

| Field | What it means | How to use it |
|-------|---------------|---------------|
| **Target name** | Project or path scanned | Groups history in the dashboard |
| **Aggregate risk** | Single 0–100 headline score | Trend over time; **lower is better** |
| **Findings** | Total count after filters | Volume indicator, not the only metric |
| **Critical / High / …** | Count per severity band | Most teams gate on **Critical + High** |

If the scan fails your gate, the CLI prints:

```
Failing: findings at/above High.
```

and exits with code **1** (see [Exit codes](#exit-codes)).

After the findings table, Argus prints a **Security posture** panel summarizing
pass/fail, what to fix first, and your risk score — so you do not have to
interpret raw numbers alone.

---

## Risk score (0–100)

Each finding has its own risk score. The **aggregate risk** for the whole scan
is computed from all findings:

- The **worst finding sets the floor** — one Critical dominates many Low items.
- Additional findings nudge the score up slightly (volume matters, but less than severity).
- **0** = no findings. **100** = worst-case stack of issues.

| Score range | Typical meaning |
|-------------|-----------------|
| **0–20** | Clean or only Low/Info noise |
| **21–50** | Medium issues present; review when convenient |
| **51–80** | High-severity issues; fix before release |
| **81–100** | Critical or many High issues; treat as urgent |

Compare **your score to your last scan**, not to an abstract “perfect 0”. A
team that went from 85 → 40 is improving even if 40 is not zero.

---

## Severity levels

| Severity | Meaning | Typical examples |
|----------|---------|------------------|
| **Critical** | Exploitable or actively dangerous | Live secrets, RCE patterns, critical CVEs with known exploit |
| **High** | Serious; fix before merge/deploy | High CVEs, SQL injection sinks, unsafe CI patterns |
| **Medium** | Worth fixing; may not block CI | Unpinned GitHub Actions, weak hashes, medium CVEs |
| **Low** | Informational or lower-confidence | Stale deps, style-level hygiene |
| **Info** | Awareness only | Coverage notes, scan metadata |

Your **gate** is your choice. Common defaults:

```bash
# Block on High and Critical (most teams)
argus scan . --fail-on high

# Stricter — also block Medium
argus scan . --fail-on medium

# Report only — never fail the command
argus scan .
```

Set a project default in `.argus.yml`:

```yaml
fail_on: high
```

---

## Exit codes

Stable for scripts and CI:

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **0** | Scan finished; no finding at/above `--fail-on` (or no gate set) |
| **1** | Scan finished; at least one finding met the `--fail-on` threshold |
| **2** | Target could not be resolved (bad path, clone failed, config error) |

Full CI details: [CI/CD integration](ci-cd.md).

---

## How different users know they are “OK”

### Developer (terminal)

```bash
argus scan . --profile standard --fail-on high
echo $?   # 0 = pass for today
```

Also check the severity line: **Critical: 0 · High: 0**.

Re-render for different readers:

```bash
argus scan . --audience dev      # what to fix and where (default table)
argus scan . --audience exec     # business summary, top 5 risks
argus scan . --audience auditor  # CWE / OWASP taxonomy for evidence
```

### CI/CD (automatic on every PR)

```yaml
- uses: Argus-CodeSecurity/Argus-appsec@v0.8.1
  with:
    fail-on: high
    profile: ci
```

| CI status | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| Green check | No High+ findings in that commit |
| Red build | High or Critical present — merge blocked |

### Team lead (Argus Cloud dashboard)

After `argus push`, open **Dashboard → Overview**:

| Widget | “Good” signal |
|--------|----------------|
| **Critical findings** | **0** |
| **Severity donut** | No growing red/orange slice |
| **Average risk score** | Stable or **decreasing** |
| **Recent scans** | Risk column not spiking |

Open **Scan detail** for one run:

| Section | “Good” signal |
|---------|----------------|
| **Risk score** | Lower than previous scan on same target |
| **Drift since previous scan** | **New findings: 0** (no regression) |
| **Resolved** | Increasing over time as you fix issues |

### Security / compliance (export)

Paid Argus Cloud plans: **Dashboard → Compliance** exports CSV/JSON with
findings, severities, CWEs, and timestamps for auditors.

---

## Drift — are you getting better or worse?

One scan is a snapshot. **Drift** compares two snapshots:

```bash
argus scan . -f json -o before.json
# … make changes …
argus scan . -f json -o after.json
argus drift before.json after.json --fail-on high
```

| Drift column | Meaning |
|--------------|---------|
| **Added** | New findings since last scan — investigate |
| **Removed** | Fixed since last scan — good |
| **Severity changed** | Same issue, different priority |

Continuous monitoring:

```bash
argus watch . --interval 300 --fail-on-drift high
argus agent --init   # server paths; see agent.md
```

Argus Cloud shows the same drift on each scan detail page automatically when
you push consecutive scans for the same target.

---

## Accepted risk (when a finding is intentional)

Not every alert is a bug. Use:

- **`allow:` in `.argus.yml`** — documented suppressions with optional expiry
- **`# argus-ignore:` comments** — inline, with required reason
- **Dashboard → Exceptions** (Argus Cloud) — org-wide VEX by fingerprint

See [Triage & baselines](triage.md) for full syntax.

A finding you **accepted with a reason** should not count against your posture
once suppressed. A finding you **ignored without documenting** still counts.

---

## What Argus scans (and what it skips)

### Scanned by default

- Application source, dependency manifests, lockfiles
- CI/CD workflow files, Docker/K8s/IaC when present
- Secrets and patterns in tracked project files

### Skipped automatically

Common noise paths: `node_modules/`, `.venv/`, `dist/`, `.git/`, and similar.

### Configure exclusions

```yaml
# .argus.yml
exclude_paths:
  - "tests/fixtures/**"
  - "vendor/**"
```

!!! warning "Local secrets vs repository secrets"
    Argus scans **files on disk**, including gitignored files like `.env` if
    they exist locally. A Critical finding in `.env` on your laptop is **not**
    the same as a secret committed to git. Exclude local-only files in
    `.argus.yml`, or scan in CI where `.env` does not exist:

    ```yaml
    exclude_paths:
      - ".env"
      - ".env.*"
    ```

---

## Practical checklist: “Am I secure enough?”

Use this after every release candidate:

```
[ ] argus scan . --fail-on high          → exit 0
[ ] Critical count = 0, High count = 0   → in terminal summary
[ ] CI Argus job green on main branch
[ ] Dashboard: no new High+ drift since last deploy
[ ] Known false positives documented in allow: or Exceptions
[ ] Dependency CVEs reviewed (even if Medium/Low)
```

---

## Example scenarios

### Scenario A — Clean OSS project

```
Aggregate risk: 44.9/100   Findings: 26
Critical: 0 · High: 0 · Medium: 26
Exit: 0
```

**Verdict:** Passes `--fail-on high`. Medium items (e.g. unpinned GitHub Actions)
are hygiene — fix when convenient, not release blockers unless you gate on Medium.

### Scenario B — App with open High issues

```
Aggregate risk: 99.7/100   Findings: 47
Critical: 1 · High: 18
Failing: findings at/above High.
Exit: 1
```

**Verdict:** Does **not** meet the standard High gate. Triage Critical first,
then High CVEs and secrets. Re-scan until exit 0.

### Scenario C — Whole monorepo scanned by mistake

Scanning a parent folder that contains benchmark apps, examples, and tests will
inflate counts dramatically. **Scan each deployable app separately**, or use
`exclude_paths` for non-production trees.

## Quick reference

| Question | Where to look |
|----------|---------------|
| Did I pass my policy? | Exit code + `Failing:` line + Critical/High counts |
| How bad is it overall? | Aggregate risk score (trend, not absolute) |
| What regressed? | `argus drift` or Cloud scan detail → Drift |
| What should I fix first? | Table sorted by severity; `--audience exec` for top 5 |
| How do I reduce noise? | [Triage & baselines](triage.md) |
| How do I gate CI? | [CI/CD integration](ci-cd.md) |
| Cloud history & teams? | Push with `argus push`; see Argus Cloud dashboard |
